User Study #1, Mike Collins, very experienced in Javascript for Firefox extensions, understands some Firebug implementation issues.

Time to install in new profile 4 minutes (He has lots of experience here)
Time to try intro.html example 1minute

Tried Basic (no problems)
Salary and Graph: got as far as I did.

Shapes with BP 3 minutes.
Moving Circles with QP. 1min 24 sec to get one line from bug, did not see semicolon.
Moving Circles with conditional BP based on QP result, still did not see bug.

Notes

Intro:
 Tried to click on TraceWatch to get info on myObject (did this one more time, but seemed to understand it would not lead anywhere).
 1) "Top of the panel" this is unclear in the intro, ... which panel? what top? Maybe "Click on the list in the tool bar above the source code"
 2) "I had 3 Qs but I expected 2 Qs, I guess my breakpoint counts as a Q". We should mark the BP special on the QP panel.
 3) Click on Q, nothing happens.Then realized the location list navigates the panel.
 4) Need to add more steps in to intro.html so that all features are explored in the intro.
 5) Need to add small screen shots to the intro page
 6) Need to store the toggle state for each query result so selection on the QP panel location back forth works better.
 7) Add one more sentence to the intro beginning: "lastChange is a new debugging technique that automatically finds where values are changes. This test will teach you about lastChange then compare it to breakpoints".
 8) Add text at bottom: "Close the page to go back" (also to the case0, 1, 2,...
 9) oldValue lastChange fails

Shapes:
 "I was mad because said I could not use lastChange"
Circles
 Can't see the intermediate values, esp Math.random().
 Wanted to single step from the Querypoint result
 Tried conditional breakpoint from QP result.

Overall
 Implementation works well, need a progress bar to know its doing something.
 "got me to where I needed to go quickly."
