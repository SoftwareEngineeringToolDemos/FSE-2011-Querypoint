The log is attached. You can load it in to FBTrace window with Tools > Load from File. Then you can look for the time info we discussed.


Notes:

[+] on trace watch still confusing

Panel name should be Querypoints not QP

Basic (case0):

Doing lastChange on oldValue does nothing. Need to indicate the case where there are no lastChanges, this is it.

Hover over on the QP panel should offer 'lastChange" values. Or last 5 values.

Moving Circle (with BP)
 user hit reload first time rather than replay
 searched by text search for "drawCircle" then "getRandomVector"
    (unexpected so not timed).
 "let me guess: the defaultValues are wrong?" Inspects code, decides that they are ok.
   (At this point they are already at the bug area)
 "somebody modified defaultValues?"
 (Why not use bps? Sometimes they don't hit, don't give the right info).

Shapes (with QP)
 Wants to use lastChange on text in the QP panel area.
 No way to confirm bug is found unless we change the JS code.
