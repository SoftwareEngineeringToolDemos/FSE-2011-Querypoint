      This page contains an object "myObject",
      whenever user clicks, "myObject.myProperty" value increases by 3.
       To see how <i>lastChange</i> works set a breakpoint on line 17-where
        the value is written on the page. Reload the page and click.
        The breakpoint hits. In the right panel, check the value of <b>this.myObject.myProperty</b>.
        The value is 3. Now right click on <b>myProperty</b> and select <i>lastChange</i>.
        As you see, in QP panel you can see the location of the last change of <b>myObject.myProperty</b>
        and the program state at the right side.
        You can still ask for another <i>lastChange</i>. From the right panel select <b>this.myObject.myProperty</b>.
        Right click on <b>myProperty</b> and select <i>lastChange</i>. Now debugger shows
        a new location.
        All three locations, breakpoint, the first last change and the second last change are listed
        in the menu at the top of the panel.
    </P>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> The implementation of <i>lastChange</i> is not yet complete for some cases (e.g., root variables). In
            such cases you don't get any result from <i>lastChange</i> query.
